# nucleus: a diy text editor
For our project, we are going to build our own terminal-based text editor. Our MVP will be a simple editor that can read, write, and append to files. Ideally, this would include allowing the user to open and edit as many files as they like before closing the text editor. We also aim to incorporate robust error handling into our system. Other features we could implement could include keyboard shortcuts or a simple GUI to make it more user-friendly. With a simple GUI, we could also work on including other visual features like syntax highlighting, which is a useful feature of many text editors.
