# Learning Goals

Shreya: My personal learning goals for this project are to gain practical experience with C so that I can become more comfortable with writing C code. I especially want to become more comfortable with pointers and memory allocation, as these are facets that are unique to C that I haven't dealt with as much in my past programming experience. A slightly less important but motivating goal for me is to build something with actual utility.
