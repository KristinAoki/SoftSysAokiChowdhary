# nucleus: a diy text editor
## Shreya Chowdhary and Kristin Aoki

# Project Goal

For our project, we are going to build our own terminal-based text editor. Our MVP will be a simple editor that can read, write, and append to files. Ideally, this would include allowing the user to open and edit as many files as they like before closing the text editor. We also aim to incorporate robust error handling into our system. Other features we could implement could include keyboard shortcuts or a simple GUI to make it more user-friendly. With a simple GUI, we could also work on including other visual features like syntax highlighting, which is a useful feature of many text editors.

# Learning Goals

Shreya: My personal learning goals for this project are to gain practical experience with C so that I can become more comfortable with writing C code. I especially want to become more comfortable with pointers and memory allocation, as these are facets that are unique to C that I haven't dealt with as much in my past programming experience. A slightly less important but motivating goal for me is to build something with actual utility.

Kristin: My learning goals are to become more comfortable programming in C and to contribute to a project that is interesting and could possibly be used for future applications.

# Getting Started

## Resources

The main resource we're planning to utilize throughout this project is this tutorial: [Kilo Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). This tutorial presents a more fully-formed version of what we could achieve, but we can take inspiration from it and use it to guide us.

Other resources that we will consult (related to the tutorial):
* [Documentation for the termios struct](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html)
* [Wikipedia article about escape sequences in C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C)
* [VT100 User Guide for more info about escape sequences](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html)

## First Steps
1. Read through the Kilo tutorial and gain understanding of the different parts
2. By the end of the week, we want to build a very basic version of the text editor that allows a user to open one file and read/write to it. This will be very similar to Ex03.
3. By the end of next week, we want to implement interaction with multiple files.

After this point, we will evaluate where we're at and see what direction we want to go in, if we have the capacity.
